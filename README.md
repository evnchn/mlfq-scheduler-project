# MLFQ Scheduler Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler in C, based on the provided skeleton and instructions.

## Files

*   `mlfq.c`: The complete implementation of the MLFQ scheduler.
*   `tests/pa2_given_io/`: Directory containing the provided sample I/O files.
    *   `in01.txt`: Sample input file.
    *   `out01.txt`: Expected output for `in01.txt`.
    *   `my_out01.txt`: The output generated by the current `mlfq.c` implementation for `in01.txt`.

## Status

The `mlfq.c` implementation is complete and passes the provided sample test case (`in01.txt`) with some minor differences in the Gantt chart which may require further investigation into the exact tie-breaking rules. The implementation includes:

1.  Input parsing for queue configuration and process table.
2.  Queue management (enqueue/dequeue).
3.  MLFQ simulation loop with preemption by arrival and demotion on full time slice usage.

## Next Steps (For User)

1.  Review `mlfq.c` for correctness.
2.  Compare `tests/pa2_given_io/my_out01.txt` with `tests/pa2_given_io/out01.txt` to resolve the remaining discrepancy in the Gantt chart.
3.  Create additional test cases to ensure full coverage of MLFQ rules.
4.  Implement and run a comprehensive test suite.
